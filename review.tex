\section*{Giselle Gomez}
Giselle has been great to work with so far. She's on the ball and helped keep our group moving forward. She spearheaded the effort to combine our tuples into the Whoosh! database.

\section*{Richie Zhang}
Richie is a dependable team member, though it can be difficult to delegate tasks to him. He brought roughly a third of our tuples to our database. He also worked with Giselle to finish the report and complete the Examples section of the document.
